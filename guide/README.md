# Introduction

Omniship is a shipping library for PHP that allows you to determine accurate shipping rates, retrieve tracking information, generate shipping labels and much more.

It has been designed with a consistent and clean API in mind with the sole purpose to allow you to perform these cumbersome tasks with less code, so you can focus on doing the real work quickly.

Omniship handles all the communication with the carrier's API and returns the data in an usable and clean format.

### Why use Omniship?

So, why use Omniship instead of a carrier's official PHP library code?

- Because you can learn a single API, for different shipping carriers and use it in multiple projects.
- Because if you need to change shipping carriers you won't need to rewrite your entire code.
- Because most official PHP shipping carriers libraries are a mess.
- Because most official shipping carriers libraries have very poor documentation.
- Because most official shipping carriers libraries...oh well, you get the point.
